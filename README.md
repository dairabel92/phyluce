phyluce: software for UCE (and general) phylogenomics
-----------------------------------------------------

phyluce_ (phy-**loo**-chee) is a software package that was initially developed
for analyzing data collected from ultraconserved elements in organismal genomes.

The package now includes a number of tools spanning:

- the assembly of raw read data to contigs
- the identification of UCE contigs
- parallel alignment generation, alignment trimming, and alignment data summary
  methods in preparation for analysis
- alignment and SNP calling using UCE or other types of raw-read data.

As it stands, the phyluce_ package is useful for analyzing both data collected
from UCE loci and also data collection from other types of loci for phylogenomic
studies at the species, population, and individual levels.

Please see the `Documentation <http://faircloth-lab.github.com/phyluce/>`_ for
